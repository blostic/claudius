# Cloudmate

Claudusia is a easy-to-use domain specific language for clouds experiments. Language is built on [fog.io](http://fog.io), which provides flexible and powerful way to manage virtual machines instances on various cloude poviders. Connections with virtual machines are based on ssh. In order to present experiment flow, DSL generates readable graph of execution (using  [graph](https://github.com/seattlerb/graph)).

To use the DSL in your code, let's require the gem:

```ruby
require 'cloudusia'
```
